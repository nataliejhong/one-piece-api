# one-piece-api
Created this api to send back information about straw hat pirates from One Piece.

# How to use
Use this url: https://one-piece-oda-api.herokuapp.com/
* Add: api/[INSERT NAME] to the end of url to get specific information back about each crew member

# Lessons Learned
* Before creating an heroku api, make sure to create a repository first and push all the code into github. 
* I was able to successfully create my first own API and once you make a request, it sends back info.

# Future Improvements
* Add more to the page so that someone can input info in a box and the information will show directly on page instead of individually calling the members in the URL
